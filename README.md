# Crime-Analysis-Tools
Python-based tools for crime pattern analysis, heatmap generation, and data-driven decision-making in public security.

Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python-based tools developed to support crime analysis and law enforcement operations. The tools are designed to identify crime patterns, generate heatmaps, and optimize resource allocation, contributing to more efficient and proactive policing strategies.

Key Features
Crime Heatmap Generator: Visualizes crime hotspots using geospatial data, helping to identify patterns and allocate resources effectively.

Facial Recognition System: Accelerates the identification of suspects using OpenCV and Python.

Data Analysis Scripts: Processes and analyzes crime data to support data-driven decision-making.

Automation Tools: Streamlines report generation and other repetitive tasks, saving time and improving accuracy.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Geopandas

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Elasticsearch (for data storage and retrieval)
